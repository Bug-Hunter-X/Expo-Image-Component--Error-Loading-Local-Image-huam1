The solution involves verifying the file path, ensuring file accessibility, and handling potential errors. Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Image, View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const imagePath = require('./path/to/your/image.jpg'); // Use require for local images

  return (
    <View>
      <Image source={imagePath} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
      {/*Optional error handling
      {imagePath ? null : <Text>Image not found</Text>}
      */}
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

**Explanation:**

* **Using `require()`:** Using `require()` is the preferred method for accessing local assets within your React Native project.  It handles file paths automatically.  Make absolutely sure the path is correct and the image is in the correct folder.
* **Error Handling (Optional):** The optional code checks if the image exists before rendering it. This prevents the app from crashing if the image is missing.
* **Permissions:** If you're still encountering issues, ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access the file. However, local assets usually don't require additional permissions.

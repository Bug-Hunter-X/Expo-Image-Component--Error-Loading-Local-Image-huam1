This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a local URI that's not properly formatted or accessible.  Here's a common scenario:

```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'file:///path/to/image.jpg' }} />
```

If the path is incorrect, or if the image doesn't exist at that path, you'll encounter this error. Another potential cause is a permission issue preventing the app from accessing the file.
